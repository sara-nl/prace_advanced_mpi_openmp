# About
This repository contains slides for the three-day course "MPI and OpenMP in Scientific Software Development" hosted by SURF. Each branch corresponds to a particular year of the course. The main branch contains the materials from the latest year.

The slides from invited speakers are located in the `invited_talks` folder. Big thanks to Dr. Xavier Álvarez Farré for sharing his slides with us.

You can find practical examples and solutions in the following repositories:
- Jacobi solver: https://github.com/sara-nl/prace_jacobi
- MPI topologies and domain decomposition: https://github.com/sara-nl/prace_topologies

The main branch of every repository contains the original "tamplate" code. The additional branches are named by days and correspond 
to the final state of the code achieved on a particular day.
